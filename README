GnuCash_Django is a web interface for GnuCash using Django. It uses the Python
bindings to the the GnuCash API and does not use Django's database features.

Status
------

Just starting out. Not useful except as an example of how this can work. Start
by looking at views.py to see how the API is used.


GnuCash Python API Installation
-------------------------------

# I found I needed to build GnuCash 2.4 from source and use the following
# steps to get the Python binding working on Ubuntu 12.04:
cd gnucash
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/to/gnucash --enable-compile-warnings \
    --with-html-engine=webkit --disable-error-on-warning \
     --enable-python-bindings
make
sudo make install
sudo mkdir /usr/local/python2.7/site-packages/gnucash
sudo cp -R src/optional/python-bindings/* \
    /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gnucash/
sudo cp src/optional/python-bindings/.libs/*so* \
    /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gnucash/

# /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages must be in sys.path for
# import gnucash to work. This is done in session_manager.py


Django Installation
-------------------

# These instructions work on Ubuntu 12.04. If you don't have a Django
# installation already:

sudo apt-get install python-django libapache2-mod-wsgi
cd /path_readable_by_apache/
django-admin startproject django_installation

# Make a file called /etc/apache2/sites_available/django and put this in it:

WSGIScriptAlias /django /path_readable_by_apache/django_installation/django.wsgi

# Make a file called /path_readable_by_apache/django_installation/django.wsgi
# and put this in it:

import os
import sys

paths = ['/path_readable_by_apache', '/path_readable_by_apache/django_installation']
for path in paths:
    if path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(path)

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'django_installation.settings'

import django.core.handlers.wsgi
application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()


GnuCash_Django installation
---------------------------

# Copy the source files into:
/path_readable_by_apache/django_installation/gnucash_django/

# Edit your /path_readable_by_apache/django_installation/settings.py. Add the
# following to the TEMPLATE_DIRS list:
'/path_readable_by_apache/django_installation/gnucash_django/templates',

# Add the following to the INSTALLED_APPS list:
'gnucash_django',

# Copy the gnucash_config_example.py file:
cd /path_readable_by_apache/django_installation/gnucash_django/
cp gnucash_config_example.py gnucash_config.py

# Edit gnucash_config.py to configure your gnucash file or database.

# Finally, as a workaround (FIXME this is probably not correct):
sudo mkdir /var/www/.gnucash
sudi chmod a+rw /var/www/.gnucash


Security
--------

This Django app does not attempt to provide any security. Take care not to
publish your accounts on the Internet. It is possible that this app exposes
the GnuCash API to the Internet and thereby allows attackers to compromise
your machine. It is possible that men in the middle can read your network
packets and see your accounts.

Suggested precautions:

* Use web server authentication features to control access to the pages
  served by Django such as, on Apache:

  Order deny,allow
  AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
  AuthName "Restricted Access"
  AuthType Basic
  require user someuser

* Only allow access via https.
